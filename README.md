A simple and a small NSStatusBarApp, which can be used as a template for your own projects. The application does not use Storyboard and is perfect for showcasing how to add buttons on your Status Bar via Swift file. 

Urly is a useful mini status bar application that simplifies your daily life by making your copied links clickable and also converts your copied URL into BBCode without any hassle or typing out long BBCode. Really, a time saver!

The application will work on OS X 10.10 - 10.14 and is written in Swift 4. The earlier versions of Mac OS X are ufortunately unsupported.
